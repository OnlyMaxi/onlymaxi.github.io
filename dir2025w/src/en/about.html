            <h3>Offline Mode</h3>
            <p>
                The core scanning functionality of CuREx can be used in an offline mode. Updates to the malware database are optional and user-controlled, making CuREx suitable for isolated systems, older hardware, or environments with limited internet connectivity.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="insert-column">
            <h3>It's All In The Name!</h3>
            <p>
                CuREx stands for
                <strong>Cu</strong>stomizable
                <strong>R</strong>ecursive
                <strong>Ex</strong>terminator.
                <br>
                CuREx uses a signature-based scanning engine combined with recursive file analysis to identify known malware binaries. The scanning process is optimized for performance and accuracy, ensuring that even large directory structures can be analyzed efficiently without noticeable system slowdowns.
            </p>

            <h3>You Keep The Control</h3>
            <p>
                CuREx is designed with transparency in mind. Every scan result is clearly documented and no actions are taken without explicit user consent. The software does not run hidden background processes and does not collect personal files or usage data beyond what is strictly necessary for malware detection.
            </p>

            <h3>No Ads Or Feature Bloating</h3>
            <p>
                CuREx is aimed at private users, students, small organizations, and technically interested individuals who want a reliable malware scanner without subscriptions, advertisements, or unnecessary background services.

            <h3>Where We Operate</h3>
            <p>
                Based in Vienna, Austria, CuREx GmbH operates under European Union regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Compliance with applicable legal and ethical standards is an integral part of our development process.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="insert-column">
            <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
            <p>
                CuREx GmbH was founded with the goal of providing accessible and trustworthy security software to everyone. We strongly believe that basic digital security should not depend on expensive subscriptions or aggressive monetization strategies. Our brand symbol, the CuREx syringe, stands for the ability for anyone to provide "healthcare" to their system.
            </p>

            <h3>Our Business Model</h3>
            <p>
                Our work is primarily funded through voluntary donations and community support. This allows us to focus entirely on product quality and user trust rather than advertising revenue or data-driven business models.
            </p>

            <h3>Our Team</h3>
            <p>
                Our interdisciplinary team consists of software developers, security researchers, and legal advisors. We work in small, focused teams and emphasize code review, documentation, and compliance with European data protection standards.
            </p>

            <h3>Future Lookout</h3>
            <p>
                While CuREx currently focuses on file-based malware detection, future versions may include optional extensions and integrations, always following our core principles of transparency, user control, and minimalism.
